# MECH2101-Mechanical-CAD-and-CAM
Kepler short-course on the fundamentals of mechanical design, drafting, and manufacture.

Outline of this course is underway; you can follow our progress Friday mornings at 6am CDT at www.tsog.tv.

The focus of this course is to teach students how to produce parts, assemblies, and drawings in modern mechanical CAD software, how to consider the interaction between parts they are either drafting or designing themselves, and how to speak the language of manufacturing. Students who have completed this course should understand the basics of working around manufacturing design rules, and be able to produce simple assemblies for real-world applications.

### Notes from first Standing Meeting (8/23/19):
Goals for students:

*	Learning the language of manufacturing. (set ups, part orientation, end mill size, pockets, etc.)
*	Be able to produce parts, assemblies, and drawings.
*	Understand interaction between parts (assembly) â€“ both existing parts and parts that they are designing. Steps they can take to make fewer mistakes in assembly.
*	Basics of stress, strain, and design constraints based around those things such as minimum feature size / wall thicknesses.
*	Understanding / working around design rules.
*	Understanding critical dimensions.

**Action items:**

Dr. F - Draft tutorials for LEGO brick and chess pawn modeling in Alibre Design; draft syllabus and CLOs.

Mr. Schwartz - Install Alibre Design, review Dr. F's tutorials.

ALL - Brainstorm design project ideas that will form the through-line for the course.

### Notes from Standing Meeting (9/6/19):
Discussed updates to Alibre Design and parameterization of models. Determined that parameterization is useful when dealing with families of parts like LEGO bricks, but probably more trouble than it is worth with many other models.

Discussed the flow of the course. Should we introduce blueprint reading first, or cover the software tutorial in lesson 1 instead as planned? Ultimately decided to not let blueprint reading get in the way of introducing the software. Will introduce this later, possibly alongside discussion on variations and tolerance.

Larger project for the course should start no later than the 3rd lesson to leave enough time. Discussed a flashlight, clock, and other household items as potential projects. Toward the end of the discussion, landed on simple toys - such as a walking wind-up toy - as good examples of mechanical mechanism that are relateable, interesting, and contain a wide array of potential talking points.

**Action items:**

Dr. F - Finish Alibre Design tutorial; draft syllabus and CLOs.

ALL - Investigate toy mechanisms for final project; begin planning remainder of the course.
