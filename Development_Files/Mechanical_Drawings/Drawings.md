These are work in progress notes for a introductory lesson on mechanical drawings. This text would benefit tremendously from diagrams and pictures to accompany explanations.

This may later be broken up into (multiple) dedicated lessons or sprinkled throughout other lessons.

- Types of lines / line styles: visible (solid), hidden (dashed), center lines
- How to read a drawing

Outline of reading a drawing:
1. Look at the title block to understand who, what, and scale (this is the context).
2. Find the primary (front) view, look for the outside part dimensions (length, width, and height).
3. Find the projected top and left/right views. Begin to comprehend the envelope of the part.
4. Look at the dimensions in each of these views paying careful attention to clusters of dimensions around important features.

# Mechanical Drawings

Mechanical drawings (often called 'blueprints' or just 'prints') are a two dimensional representation of a part's shape, geometry, and size or dimension. Drawings can also be used to communicate a variety of important engineering (meta) data: manufacturing specifications; mechanical interaction between parts; material properties; and even finishes and other aesthetics. Beyond parts, prints are often created for families of parts and assemblies with each drawing playing a specific role.

> With all of the powerful 3D CAD software available today, it may seem that two dimensional drawings must be an outdated or obsolete way of communicating mechanical design. However, 2D drawings are still a very important tool for communicating one's 3D designs and can sometimes convey information a 3D model cannot.

> In some cases, drawings are even the _primary_ means of communicating design data to manufacturers; errors in the creation and interpretation of mechanical drawings can mean the difference between receiving a good part and a bad part. The ability to read, understand, and create clear, communicative drawings is a critical skill!

Engineering drawings, unlike more artistic representations, are created (and interpreted) in a methodical, standardized way to show the design of a part. A good blueprint covers the design in a clear and minimal way; we'd like another individual to understand our part completely with as little information as possible. This eliminates confusion from ambiguity or contradiction.

With that said, there are few hard requirements for mechanical drawings so style and personal preference are a part of every drawing. Being consistent with decisions and sticking to already established conventions should be the overall goal.

# What Makes a Drawing

## Drawing Views

The process of mathematically converting a 3D object to a 2D plane is called *projection*. A drawing is simply a collection of projected *views* that completely illustrate the shape of a part. It's standard for these views to be created at right angles to one another (on orthogonal planes).

> **Aside**: The type of projection used in mechanical drawings is called *orthographic* projection. Unlike *perspective* projection (which projects in much the same ways our eyes do), orthographic projection does **not** cause object or features at a distance to appear smaller. Parallel lines in orthographic projection do not converge to vanishing points.
>
> These characteristics are important for blueprints since we do not want the selection of a viewpoint to alter how we perceive the part overall.

This is all a fancy way of saying that a drawing shows one view for each of the top, sides, and bottom of a part.

These views all project from a "primary" view of the part which is generally chosen to show the largest number of important features or give the best overview. This is usually the front view by convention. Side views are then displayed to the left and right of the front view whereas top and bottom views go above and below.

Each view is carefully aligned to the other so that a feature visible in two separate views can be connected with a vertical or horizontal line. Reading a print often involves carefully looking back and forth between various views to interpret features and their shape. This alignment makes it easier for the eye.

> **Aside**: Depending on your location, there are two different methods for laying out projected views: first angle projection and third angle projection. These methods prescribe which side the left (or top) and right (or bottom) views should go. In first angle projection, the _right_ view actually ends up on the _left_ side of the front view!
